                                        However, our team likewise uses the tool to study how students collaborate
                                        and how students learn in these classes.

                                        We strive to involve undergraduates, particularly underclassmen, in undergraduate
                                        research by acting as an intermediary between undergraduate students, and
                                        graduate students and faculty, placing new researchers into active research
                                        projects each semester. Many of these students continue long term research
                                        with their mentors, and we believe this experience is a critical component
                                        of an undergraduate education.
