        <p>BUFFALO, N.Y. -- A high-profile Canadian sports doctor charged earlier this year with smuggling unapproved drugs into the United States to treat professional athletes was formally indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>The five-count indictment alleges that Dr. Anthony Galea, 51, of Toronto, smuggled human growth hormone and other unapproved substances into the U.S. and conspired and lied to border agents to avoid getting caught.</p>
        <p>The charges, similar to those contained in a criminal complaint in May, set Galea on the path to trial.</p>
        <p>The doctor, who is not authorized to work in the United States, is accused of treating 20 professional athletes at their homes, hotels and friends' houses from October 2007 to September 2009, including giving them free Viagra if they asked.</p>
        <p>The indictment does not identify any athletes by name, but as the case moves toward trial, evidence and witness statements could be revealed in court, said U.S. Attorney William Hochul, whose office is prosecuting the case....</p>

      <p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars  players have voted to give the NFL Players Association their backing to decertify the union in the event of a labor lockout next year.</p>
      <p>The Jaguars are the 15th group of players to vote to decertify if necessary.</p>
      <p>Each of the 32 teams is voting whether to give the union the right to decertify if teams lock out players next year. It's a procedural matter. Decertification would give the union a chance to sue under antitrust laws if there is a lockout.</p>
      <p>Without decertification, the union would have to wait six months to file a suit after the CBA expired.</p>
      <p>Jordan Black is the team's union representative.</p>
      <p>"We just want to play," Black said. "It was a meeting to show our commitment. We need the owners and they need us."</p>
