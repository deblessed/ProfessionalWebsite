This project is written purely in Java, and presents a GUI for exporting images to compressed RLE and other image compression formats using additional bitwise compression algorithms such as Gzip, Bzip, and zip archives commonly used in Windows. Compression functionality is highly configurable and allows both importing and exporting compressed and uncompressed images.

Likewise, this project uses Java's Swing framework to built a complex GUI that allows arbitrary filters, distortions, and effects on images, as well as importing and exporting a variety of standard and custom image formats.
