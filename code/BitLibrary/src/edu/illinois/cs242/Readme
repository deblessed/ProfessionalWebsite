To run the main application, now run the main method of Photoshop.

Improvements to this version:
    1) Refactored factory for menu actions into factories for each menu to eliminate
        'MenuActionTypes' and reduce the size of each replacement file
    2) Improved file dialog functionality to use file filters (no more type errors)
    3) Refactored main method so that PhotoShop now functions as the starting point
        for the program. This makes the '...Window' files in the View more consistent
    4) Refactored image effects, moving all image effects into PixelEffects.java
    5) Added multiple subMenus for types of image effects
    6) Added LOTS of extra image effects
    7) Added key listeners
    8) Added optional Zip compression layers (GUI hooked into implementation, and implementation in place but debugging required)
    9) Added tooltips to GUI
    10) Added GUI system enhancement (look and feel set by system)
    11) Added key listeners to popups and fixed popups

Problems that remain:
    1) IndexedColor compression still messes with colors
    2) Zip, Gzip, and Bzip compression code is written, but not working
