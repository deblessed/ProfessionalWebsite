<p>
    This summer, I spent the first month of my internship working on a project reminiscent
    of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, a powerful asynchronous server-side Javascript
    networking library. While node.js allows possesses tremendous ability to perform
    efficient Javascript networking, the current browser security model inhibits similar
    client-side functionality, until SockIt.
</p>
<p>
    SockIt, in a nutshell, is an NPAPI browser plugin that circumvents the traditional browser
    security model, allowing pages to perform low-level networking via client-side javascript.
    While it is being actively developed, it already possesses extensive TCP and UDP functionality,
    and even boasts a custom implementation of the heavily-used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>
    protocol that supports batch callbacks.
</p>
<p>
    Similar to node.js, its networking is performed entirely asynchronously, and it supports
    variety of cross platform browsers. It is newly open sourced, and hosted on
    <a href="http://github.com/sockit/sockit">GitHub</a>, and extensive documentation and
    tutorials are available <a href="http://sockit.github.com/">here</a>.
