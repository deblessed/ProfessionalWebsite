<p>
    This extension will allow the ACM's collaborative music player to automatically
    select good songs to play based on users in the room at any given time.
</p>
<p>
    Our extension's implementation was broken into three primary components:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        First, our application receives an socket-based request from Acoustics, which consists
        of a set of users for which to find the set of tags that best represents the users'
        common musical tastes.
    </li><br/>
    <li>
        Using score-based and tag-based filtering mechanisms, find a set of tags that represents
        the common interests of the given users.
    </li><br/>
    <li>
        Use this ordered set of tags as a query to a Lucene index, where documents are represented
        as songs indexed by tags. Finally, return this set of songs to Acoustics as the final result.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

    Below, we show a full diagram of the architecture of our system:
<center><img style="padding:20px; margin-left:-10px;" width=500 src="/static/admin/images/projects/collaborative_music_filter_architecture.png"/></center>

The four most important components of this architecture we specifically:<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Last.fm crawler</li><br/>

    Runs separately from the core Java code of our project, polls the Acoustics database for new songs,
    albums, and artists, and fetches tag information from Last.fm<br/><br/>

    <li>Project API</li><br/>

    Provides a simple interface to our project from the core Acoustics code, and allows our project to be
    run separately from Acoustics<br/><br/>

    <li>Tag filter</li><br/>

    Retrieves a ranked list of high-level musical tags that best represent the musical interests of a set of users<br/><br/>

    <li>Song index</li><br/>

    Uses this list of tags as a query to generate a pseudo-randomized playlist of songs to suggest to Acoustics<br/><br/>
</ul>
