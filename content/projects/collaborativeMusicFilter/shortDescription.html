<p>
    As part of a semester project and a contribution to the open source ACM music player
    <a href="https://github.com/avuserow/amp/wiki/">Acoustics</a>, several classmates
    and myself developed a Java based music filter extension
    that searches for songs that best fit musical interests of groups of users. This project
    uses the open source toolkit Lucene, the Last.fm API, and a variety of scoring algorithms,
    one making use of the Floyd-Warshall shortest paths algorithm for graphs to compute a
    the barycenters of graphs.
