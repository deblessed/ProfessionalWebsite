<h4><br/>Coordinator</h4>
<p>
    This node provides hooks for running simulations in the shared memory system, and handles
    mutual exclusion in our implementation. It reads input files to run commands in the
    memory system, and intermediates between the nodes of the memory system.

<h4><br/>Shared Memory Node</h4>
<p>
    Each node of the memory system implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_consistency">release consistency</a>
    by locally caching data as long as it knows that it is the only process in the critical section. Whenever
    it must read some data, it contacts other nodes in the memory system, and itself holds only a small
    portion of the total data of the system.
