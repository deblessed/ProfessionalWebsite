<p>
    For our course project for <a href='https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/cs427fa11/CS+427+Fall+2011'>software engineering</a>,
    I worked with three classmates to develop a plugin for the Eclipse refactoring engine that automatically
    detects and removes duplicate code from class constructors. The project was intended to teach us how to practice XP,
    and was entirely pair-programmed, strictly adhering to the extreme programming practices.
