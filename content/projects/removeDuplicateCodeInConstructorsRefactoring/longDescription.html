    The refactoring is able to analyze any arbitrary types for constructors, detect duplicate code by tracing
    through the Java program AST, and even allows the user to customize the extraction of duplicate code found
    by the refactoring by introducing new helper methods or specifying access modifiers for methods or constuctors
    created by the refactoring. Likewise, it provides refactoring previews and analysis of program errors to
    the user via the Eclipse refactoring wizard interface.

    below, we have a <a href='https://github.com/jtedesco/RemoveDuplicateCodeFromConstructorsTests'>separate repository</a>
    containing the tests for our refactoring, providing a thorough test suite of successful and unsuccessful
    refactoring scenarios. Likewise, our full documentation, including sample use cases and a full set of
    features, can be found <a href='static/admin/papers/refactoring_project_documentation.pdf'>here</a>.
