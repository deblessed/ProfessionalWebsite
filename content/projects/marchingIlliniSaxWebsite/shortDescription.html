    Recently, I volunteered to create a website for the
    <a href="http://bands.illinois.edu/content/MI/">Marching Illini</a> saxophone section
    and while it is still a work in progress, it is off to a good start, already boasting
    Facebook and Google Groups integration for our public facebook page and private discussion forum.
