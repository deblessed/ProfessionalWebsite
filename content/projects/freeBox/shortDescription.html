    While I have only just started working on this project, I have big ideas for this
    project, and I hope that takes shape quickly once I find sufficient time to work on it.
    Essentially, this project is to create a platform independent file synchronization tool,
    much like <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, but one which will capture the power
    of rsync to efficiently transfer files and improve upon several of Dropbox's fundamental
    weak points, in my opinion.
