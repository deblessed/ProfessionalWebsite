    This system will be based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>,
    a robust and efficient file transfer tool. Ideally, it will be extremely configurable and allow for
    high-speed LAN synchronization. As a truly free alternative to Dropbox, I hope to
    add support for free, unlimited online storage by attempting to unify the plethora
    free data storage space available on the internet.
