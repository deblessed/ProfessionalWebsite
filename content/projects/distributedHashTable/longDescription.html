<h4><br/>Listener</h4>
<p>
    This process read input files, and sent commands to the entry point of the DHT
    to simulate clients requesting data or adding or leaving the DHT. This was
    used for performance analysis of the hash table, and to provide debugging hooks
    to test our implementation.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h4><br/>DHT Node</h4>
<p>
    A node in the hash table represented a single process, that could leave or join
    the table arbitrarily. When the node was connected to the hash table, it
    was aware of its predecessor and successor in the ring, and held a table that
    connected to <code>m</code> other nodes. These tables at each node formed
    hypercube-like structure within the DHT, so that traversing the entire table to
    perform some action requires on <code>log(n)</code> time.
</p>
<p>
    Since each node was represented by a separate process, all communication between
    nodes occurred via network communication. Likewise, all requests, including
    finding data in the DHT, removing data from the DHT, or modifying the DHT
    structure itself, were processed concurrently. While simple, this implementation
    is scalable across many machines.
