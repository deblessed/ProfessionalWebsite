    A C++ implementation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash table</a>
    (DHT) that consisted of two components: first, a process that uses an input file to
    run simulations of real-world use cases, and second, a DHT node, which is only aware
    of each other node in its adjacency table.
