    The site uses some <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>
    integration, and even a personalized mass email system that we regularly use to send our 500+ fans personalized
    emails with instant unsubscribe functionality. Likewise, this same email system is used to automatically generate welcome emails
    for new fans, and add them to our mailing list, and offers an administrative interface from which band members
    can initiate an eblast, or even test it in debug mode before sending.

    Written in purely in PHP, this was my first experience building a personal, database-driven website. It integrates
    with Google Analytics for analysis statistics and relies on a MySQL backend. The site has been tested and adapts to
    Firefox, Chrome, and IE.
