    For database systems fall 2010, one of my classmates and I implemented our
    first database driven website. It implements several interesting features,
    including an elegant interface, session-based login system for users, SQL
    injection protection, and automatic statistics-based game simulation.

    On a weekly basis, our website scrapes the NFL homepage for game results,
    and uses our own scoring heuristic to determine wins and losses for fantasy
    teams. Our interface allows users to create accounts, make live player trades
    with other users, and manage fantasy teams.
