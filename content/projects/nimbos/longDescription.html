<p>
    Thus far, we have recreated previous work that predicts hardware failures in cloud systems using SVMs and
    a sliding window view of logs. As detailed in our <a href='https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/download/attachments/195766887/paper.pdf?version=3&modificationDate=1331931973141'>project proposal</a>,
    we can take a similar sliding window approach, but plan to investigate alternative views of log data, as well
    as alternative machine learning algorithms.
