    Through our course project for the <a href='https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/cs598rco/Home'>graduate cloud computing course</a>,
    I have been working with two fellow BS/MS students in the department to study how we can effectively predict machine
    failures in Hadoop clusters. We hope to use Hadoop logs to improve upon previous work done in other cloud
    computing systems by leveraging machine learning to predict failures, the type of failure expected, as well
    as time of failure expected.
