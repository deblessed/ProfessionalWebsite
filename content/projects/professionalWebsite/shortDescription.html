    My professional website, which I regularly maintain to keep my projects, ideas, and r&eacute;sum&eacute; up to date. This
    site is built on <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>, a simple Python web framework with which I have had some
    experience in the past, and will soon feature full demos of projects and a fully functioning python-driven custom search
    engine, powered by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/wiki/Home">Whoosh!</a>. Likewise, the Python server, to improve performance and reduce memory footprint, makes use of
    the new JIT, or <b>J</b>ust <b>I</b>n <b>T</b>ime compiler called <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>.
