<h4><br/>Server Node</h4>
<p>
    Each server node is represented by a process in our implementation, and each server
    sends periodic heartbeats to one other server, so that the pool of servers
    forms a heartbeating ring. In our trials, server faults were always detected and recovered
    within a second. Each server held two TCP connections for heartbeating, and a TCP connection
    to the load balancer for file requests and failure detection.<br/>
</p>

<h4><br/>Load Balancer</h4>
<p>
    The load balancer was responsible for forming a layer of abstraction between the client and the
    server pool. It queued requests from the client, and recording server loads from the server pool.
    Each file requested by a client was stored at multiple server nodes, and the load balancer was responsible
    for determining the server currently under the lightest load. Likewise, the load balancer initialized the
    fault detetection system, and handled server crashes by redistributing files as necessaryr, even restarting
    active file transfers if necessary.<br/>
</p>

<h4><br/>Client</h4>
<p>
    In our implementation, the client naively requested files from a input file, without pausing
    in between requests. We used the client in our trials to test the performance and fault tolerance
    of our system.
