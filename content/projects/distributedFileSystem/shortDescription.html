<p>
    This project consisted of three parts: server nodes in the distributed
    system, a load balancer that maintains the transparency of the server pool
    to the client, and the client, which requests files, and in our tests, kills
    server arbitrary processes to test our system and ensure file validity in the
    event of failure.
