    Each of the sites mention here are hosted on my own <b>V</b>irtual <b>P</b>rivate <b>S</b>erver, which I additionally use
    for personal websites, proxies, over a dozen private <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repositories,
    and other miscellaneous projects. I am constantly looking for new ways to put this too use,
    and have a learned a tremendous amount about security and server administration in the short
    time that I have owned it.
