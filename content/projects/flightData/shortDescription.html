    This project allows import and export of data for a (fictional) company's
    flight network between a graph structure stored in memory and an external
    <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> format.
    This allows calculation of mileage, costs to the airline, and routing
    information, and was used for programming studio as an exercise in good programming
    practices. This project uses the command design pattern to allow users to seamlessly
    communicate with the backend, Doxygen for extensive automated documentation,
    and Lucene to allow for robust queries in the graph structure.
