    For programming studio, I spent a few weeks learning the Python programming language, by developing a
    feature-rich search engine for the illinois.edu domain. It features an extensive test suite built on the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito-python/">Mockito</a> test framework, and extensive auto-generated
    documentation using <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html">Doxygen</a> customized for Python.
    Likewise, it uses HTML tags to weight keywords and titles, implements politeness checking, ranks results
    using Python toolkit <a href="http://whoosh.ca/">Whoosh!</a>, and re-ranks results using Google's
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> algorithm on a graph structure stored in memory.
