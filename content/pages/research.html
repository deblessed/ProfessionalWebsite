                                    Through our efforts to analyze collaboration in undergraduate classes,
                                    we have provided a useful tool to the department, and have gained a better
                                    understanding of how students learn and understand the concepts and projects
                                    at hand.

                                <p>
                                    Through Spring 2010, I studied deep web search interfaces, and developed
                                     a set of design principles for interfaces for any deep search engine. I
                                     compared the interfaces of several existing seep web search engines and
                                     used a bottom-up analysis of these interfaces to construct a set of generalized
                                     principles for deep web search interfaces.

                                    I actively promote research through my work with <strong>P.U.R.E.</strong>,

                                      We strive to involve undergraduates, particularly underclassmen, in undergraduate
                                      research by acting as an intermediary between undergraduate students, and
                                      graduate students and faculty, placing new researchers into active research
                                      projects each semester. Many of these students continue long term research
                                      with their mentors, and we believe this experience is a critical component
                                      of an undergraduate education.
