                                    My current research interests lie in the areas of machine learning, data mining, and
                                    applications such as vertical search engines, search engines that access the

                                    I am be working with Professor <a href="https://agora.cs.illinois.edu/display/~kcchang/Home">Kevin Chang</a>
                                    and Nikita Spirin to help understand how we can search for structured information on
                                    in the unstructured data of the world wide web. I am currently working to investigate
                                    how we can search for entities using fully-qualified entity queries and existing search
                                    engine technologies.

                                <p>
                                    Since Fall 2010, I have been working with <a href="http://mias.illinois.edu/index.php?q=page/profile&id=6">Cinda Heeren</a>,
                                    <a href="http://charliemeyer.net">Charlie Meyer</a>, and <a href="http://www.cse.illinois.edu/~shaffer1/">Eric Shaffer</a>
                                    to help develop software for <a href="http://comoto.cs.illinois.edu">CoMoTo</a>.
                                    This software uses advanced software similarity analysis tools such as
                                    <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">MOSS</a>
                                    to help instructors detect cheating in several mainstream undergraduate classes.
                                    However, our team likewise uses the tool to study how students collaborate
                                    and how students learn in these classes.

                                    Through our efforts to analyze collaboration in undergraduate classes,
                                    we have provided a useful tool to the department, and have gained a better
                                    understanding of how students learn and understand the concepts and projects
                                    at hand.

                                <p>
                                    Through Spring 2010, I studied deep web search interfaces, and developed
                                     a set of design principles for interfaces for any deep search engine. I
                                     compared the interfaces of several existing seep web search engines and
                                     used a bottom-up analysis of these interfaces to construct a set of generalized
                                     principles for deep web search interfaces.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I actively promote research through my work with P.U.R.E.,
                                     <strong>P</strong>romoting <strong>U</strong>ndergraduate <strong>R</strong>esearch
                                      in <strong>E</strong>ngineering, as the liason for the computer science department.
                                      We strive to involve undergraduates, particularly underclassmen, in undergraduate
                                      research by acting as an intermediary between undergraduate students, and
                                      graduate students and faculty, placing new researchers into active research
                                      projects each semester. Many of these students continue long term research
                                      with their mentors, and we believe this experience is a critical component
                                      of an undergraduate education.
