        Each of the sites mention here are hosted on my own <b>V</b>irtual <b>P</b>rivate <b>S</b>erver, which I additionally use
        for personal websites, proxies, over a dozen private <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repositories,
        and other miscellaneous projects. I am constantly looking for new ways to put this too use,
        and have a learned a tremendous amount about security and server administration in the short
        time that I have owned it.
