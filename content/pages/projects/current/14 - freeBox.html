<h4>A free rsync-based file synchronization tool</h4>

    <p>
        While I have only just started working on this project, I have big ideas for this
        project, and I hope that takes shape quickly once I find sufficient time to work on it.
        Essentially, this project is to create a platform independent file synchronization tool,
        much like <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, but one which will capture the power
        of rsync to efficiently transfer files and improve upon several of Dropbox's fundamental
        weak points, in my opinion.

        This system will be based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>,
        a robust and efficient file transfer tool. Ideally, it will be extremely configurable and allow for
        high-speed LAN synchronization. As a truly free alternative to Dropbox, I hope to
        add support for free, unlimited online storage by attempting to unify the plethora
        free data storage space available on the internet.
