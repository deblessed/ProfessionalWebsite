<h2>DistributedSharedMemory</h2>
<h4>A distributed shared memory system implementing release consistency</h4>
<div style="padding-left:10px;">
    <p>
        This project consisted of two components: first, the coordinator, a process that uses an input and configuration
        files to run simulations of real-world use cases, and second, the shared memory node.

    <h4 class="distributed_shared_memory toHide"><br/>Coordinator</h4>
    <p class="distributed_shared_memory toHide">
        This node provides hooks for running simulations in the shared memory system, and handles
        mutual exclusion in our implementation. It reads input files to run commands in the
        memory system, and intermediates between the nodes of the memory system.

    <h4 class="distributed_shared_memory toHide">Shared Memory Node</h4>
    <p class="distributed_shared_memory toHide">
        Each node of the memory system implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_consistency">release consistency</a>
        by locally caching data
        as long as it knows that it is the only process in the critical section. Whenever it must
        read some data, it contacts other nodes in the memory system, and itself holds only
        a small portion of the total data of the system.
