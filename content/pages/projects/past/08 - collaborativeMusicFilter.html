        As part of a semester project and a contribution to the open source ACM music player
        <a href="https://github.com/avuserow/amp/wiki/">Acoustics</a>, several classmates
        and myself developed a Java based music filter extension
        that searches for songs that best fit musical interests of groups of users. This project
        uses the open source toolkit Lucene, the Last.fm API, and a variety of scoring algorithms,
        one making use of the Floyd-Warshall shortest paths algorithm for graphs to compute a
        the barycenters of graphs.

        This extension will allow the ACM's collaborative music player to automatically
        select good songs to play based on users in the room at any given time.

    <p class="collaborative_music_filter toHide">
       Our extension's implementation was broken into three primary components:
       <ul class="collaborative_music_filter toHide">
            <li>
                First, our application receives an socket-based request from Acoustics, which consists
                of a set of users for which to find the set of tags that best represents the users'
                common musical tastes.
            </li><br/>
           <li>
               Using score-based and tag-based filtering mechanisms, find a set of tags that represents
               the common interests of the given users.
           </li><br/>
           <li>
               Use this ordered set of tags as a query to a Lucene index, where documents are represented
               as songs indexed by tags. Finally, return this set of songs to Acoustics as the final result.
           </li>
       </ul>
