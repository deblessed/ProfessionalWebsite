<h2>DistributedFileSystem</h2>
<h4>A fault-tolerant distributed file system</h4>
<div style="padding-left:10px;">
    <p>
        This project consisted of three parts: server nodes in the distributed
        system, a load balancer that maintains the transparency of the server pool
        to the client, and the client, which requests files, and in our tests, kills
        server arbitrary processes to test our system and ensure file validity in the
        event of failure.

    <h4 class="distributed_file_system toHide"><br/>Server Node</h4>
    <p class="distributed_file_system toHide">
        Each server node is represented by a process in our implementation, and each server
        sends periodic heartbeats to one other server, so that the pool of servers
        forms a heartbeating ring. In our trials, server faults were always detected and recovered
        within a second. Each server held two TCP connections for heartbeating, and a TCP connection
        to the load balancer for file requests and failure detection.<br/>
    </p>
    <h4 class="distributed_file_system toHide"><br/>Load Balancer</h4>
    <p class="distributed_file_system toHide">
        The load balancer was responsible for forming a layer of abstraction between the client and the
        server pool. It queued requests from the client, and recording server loads from the server pool.
        Each file requested by a client was stored at multiple server nodes, and the load balancer was responsible
        for determining the server currently under the lightest load. Likewise, the load balancer initialized the
        fault detetection system, and handled server crashes by redistributing files as necessaryr, even restarting
        active file transfers if necessary.<br/>
    </p>
    <h4 class="distributed_file_system toHide"><br/>Client</h4>
    <p class="distributed_file_system toHide">
        In our implementation, the client naively requested files from a input file, without pausing
        in between requests. We used the client in our trials to test the performance and fault tolerance
        of our system.
