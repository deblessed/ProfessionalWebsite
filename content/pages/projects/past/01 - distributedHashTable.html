<h4>A C++ implementation of a distributed hash table</h4>

    <p>
        A C++ implementation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash table</a>
        (DHT) that consisted of two components: first, a process that uses an input file to
        run simulations of real-world use cases, and second, a DHT node, which is only aware
        of each other node in its adjacency table.

    <p class="distributed_hash_table toHide">
        This process read input files, and sent commands to the entry point of the DHT
        to simulate clients requesting data or adding or leaving the DHT. This was
        used for performance analysis of the hash table, and to provide debugging hooks
        to test our implementation.<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <h4 class="distributed_hash_table toHide">DHT Node</h4>
    <p class="distributed_hash_table toHide">
        A node in the hash table represented a single process, that could leave or join
        the table arbitrarily. When the node was connected to the hash table, it
        was aware of its predecessor and successor in the ring, and held a table that
        connected to <code>m</code> other nodes. These tables at each node formed
        hypercube-like structure within the DHT, so that traversing the entire table to
        perform some action requires on <code>log(n)</code> time.
    </p>
    <p class="distributed_hash_table toHide">
        Since each node was represented by a separate process, all communication between
        nodes occurred via network communication. Likewise, all requests, including
        finding data in the DHT, removing data from the DHT, or modifying the DHT
        structure itself, were processed concurrently. While simple, this implementation
        is scalable across many machines.
