<h2>BitLibrary</h2>
<h4>Java Based Image Editor and Image Compression Engine</h4>
<div style="padding-left:10px;">
    <p>
    This project is written purely in Java, and presents a GUI for
    exporting images to compressed RLE and other image compression formats
    using additional bitwise compression algorithms such as Gzip, Bzip, and
    zip archives commonly used in Windows. Compression functionality is
    highly configurable and allows both importing and exporting compressed
    and uncompressed images.
    </p>
    <p>
    Likewise, this project uses Java's Swing framework to built a complex GUI that
     allows arbitrary filters, distortions, and effects on images, as well as
     importing and exporting a variety of standard and custom image formats.
