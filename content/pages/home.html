                                    University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, minoring in mathematics, and
                                    pursuing the accelerated master's program at the University of Illinois.

                                   I have a passion for technology, research, and excellence, and when I am not
                                    working on school projects or spending time on the job, I develop personal
                                    projects, explore new technologies, and stay involved on campus
                                    through professional organizations and musical activities.

                                     or <strong>Co</strong>llaboration <strong>Mo</strong>nitoring <strong>To</strong>olkit.
                                     This software uses advanced software similarity analysis tools to help
                                     instructors detect cheating in several mainstream undergraduate classes.
                                     However, our team likewise uses the tool to study how students collaborate
                                     and how students learn in these classes.

                                    In the last two semester, I have actively participated in <strong>P.U.R.E.</strong>,
                                      or <strong>P</strong>romoting <strong>U</strong>ndergraduate <strong>R</strong>esearch
                                      in <strong>E</strong>ngineering, as the liason for the computer science department.
                                      We strive to involve undergraduates, particularly underclassmen, in undergraduate
                                      research by acting as an intermediary between undergraduate students, and
                                      graduate students and faculty, placing new researchers into active research
                                      projects each semester. Many of these students continue long term research
                                      with their mentors, and we believe this experience is a critical component
                                      of an undergraduate education.

                                    ensembles, the Marching Illini, the UIUC basketball band, and jazz ensembles.
