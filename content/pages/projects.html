                                                Our extension's implementation was broken into three primary components:

                                                            First, our application receives an socket-based request from Acoustics, which consists
                                                            of a set of users for which to find the set of tags that best represents the users'
                                                            common musical tastes.

                                                           Using score-based and tag-based filtering mechanisms, find a set of tags that represents
                                                           the common interests of the given users.

                                                           Use this ordered set of tags as a query to a Lucene index, where documents are represented
                                                           as songs indexed by tags. Finally, return this set of songs to Acoustics as the final result.

                                            For programming studio, I spent a few weeks learning the Python programming language, by developing a
                                            feature-rich search engine for the illinois.edu domain. It features an extensive test suite built on the
                                            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito-python/">Mockito</a> test framework, and extensive auto-generated

                                            Likewise, it uses HTML tags to weight keywords and titles, implements politeness checking, ranks results

                                                Built entirely in Python, this project consists of three primary components, the crawler, indexer, and GUI,
                                                any of which can be run separately or combined with any of the other two components.
                                                The entire project is run on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT</a>
                                                compiler <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, and is highly tunable and scalable. For a demo on my netbook
                                                at the end of this semester, I ran this project with roughly nearly 100 threads, but can easily tweak similar
                                                parameters to tune performance.

                                               <p>
                                                The crawler launches with an arbitrary amount of threads, scaling to the available number of CPUs,
                                                 and essentially outputs results into a MySQL database that is separately accessed by the indexer.
                                                 The crawler likewise implements common real world crawler features, including breadth-first crawling
                                                 and politeness checking, and uses a variety of toolkits, including

                                                 the crawler separates out the raw html content, title, and meta keywords to better search the pool of crawled pages.

                                                Each server node is represented by a process in our implementation, and each server
                                                sends periodic heartbeats to one other server, so that the pool of servers
                                                forms a heartbeating ring. In our trials, server faults were always detected and recovered
                                                within a second. Each server held two TCP connections for heartbeating, and a TCP connection
                                                to the load balancer for file requests and failure detection.

                                                The load balancer was responsible for forming a layer of abstraction between the client and the
                                                server pool. It queued requests from the client, and recording server loads from the server pool.
                                                Each file requested by a client was stored at multiple server nodes, and the load balancer was responsible
                                                for determining the server currently under the lightest load. Likewise, the load balancer initialized the
                                                fault detetection system, and handled server crashes by redistributing files as necessaryr, even restarting
                                                active file transfers if necessary.

                                                in between requests. We used the client in our trials to test the performance and fault tolerance
                                                of our system.

                                            A node in the hash table represented a single process, that could leave or join
                                            the table arbitrarily. When the node was connected to the hash table, it
                                            was aware of its predecessor and successor in the ring, and held a table that
                                            connected to <code>m</code> other nodes. These tables at each node formed
                                            hypercube-like structure within the DHT, so that traversing the entire table to
                                            perform some action requires on <code>log(n)</code> time.

                                            Since each node was represented by a separate process, all communication between
                                            nodes occurred via network communication. Likewise, all requests, including
                                            finding data in the DHT, removing data from the DHT, or modifying the DHT
                                            structure itself, were processed concurrently. While simple, this implementation
                                            is scalable across many machines.

                                            This project consisted of two components: first, the coordinator, a process that uses an input and configuration
                                            files to run simulations of real-world use cases, and second, the shared memory node.

                                            This node provides hooks for running simulations in the shared memory system, and handles
                                            mutual exclusion in our implementation. It reads input files to run commands in the
                                            memory system, and intermediates between the nodes of the memory system.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Shared Memory Node</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Each node of the memory system implements release consistency by locally caching data
                                            as long as it knows that it is the only process in the critical section. Whenever it must
                                            read some data, it contacts other nodes in the memory system, and itself holds only
                                            a small portion of the total data of the system.
