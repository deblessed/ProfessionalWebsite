                                            While I have only just started working on this project, I have big ideas for this
                                            project, and I hope that takes shape quickly once I find sufficient time to work on it.
                                            Essentially, this project is to create a platform independent file synchronization tool,
                                            much like <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, but one which will capture the power
                                            of rsync to efficiently transfer files and improve upon several of Dropbox's fundamental
                                            weak points, in my opinion.

                                            This system will be based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>,
                                            a robust and efficient file transfer tool. Ideally, it will be extremely configurable and allow for
                                            high-speed LAN synchronization. As a truly free alternative to Dropbox, I hope to
                                            add support for free, unlimited online storage by attempting to unify the plethora
                                            free data storage space available on the internet.

                                            This summer, I spent the first month of my internship working on a project reminiscent
                                            of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, a powerful asynchronous server-side Javascript

                                                SockIt, in a nutshell, is an NPAPI browser plugin that circumvents the traditional browser

                                        Built entirely in Python, this project consists of three primary components, the crawler, indexer, and GUI,
                                        any of which can be run separately or combined with any of the other two components.
                                        The entire project is run on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT</a>
                                        compiler <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, and is highly tunable and scalable. For a demo on my netbook
                                        at the end of this semester, I ran this project with roughly nearly 100 threads, but can easily tweak similar
                                        parameters to tune performance.<br/>

                                       <h4 class="pygoogle toHide"><br/>Crawler</h4>
                                       <p class="pygoogle toHide">
                                        The crawler launches with an arbitrary amount of threads, scaling to the available number of CPUs,
                                         and essentially outputs results into a MySQL database that is separately accessed by the indexer.
                                         The crawler likewise implements common real world crawler features, including breadth-first crawling
                                         and politeness checking, and uses a variety of toolkits, including
                                         <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeatifulSoup</a> for HTML parsing. Using this parser,
                                         the crawler separates out the raw html content, title, and meta keywords to better search the pool of crawled pages.<br/>

                                        The indexer scales to the resources available on the host computer, reads in the output of the crawler from
                                         a shared MySQL database, and creates a text index on the data and graph structure representing pages crawled, while
                                         simultaneously maintaining a graph in memory of pages and links between them for later use with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>
                                         algorithm. On the most recent demo with nearly 200,000 pages in the index, results were retrieved and reranked with PageRank
                                         in roughly 1/2 second.<br/>

                                            Each server node is represented by a process in our implementation, and each server
                                            sends periodic heartbeats to one other server, so that the pool of servers
                                            forms a heartbeating ring. In our trials, server faults were always detected and recovered
                                            within a second. Each server held two TCP connections for heartbeating, and a TCP connection
                                            to the load balancer for file requests and failure detection.<br/>

                                        <p class="distributed_file_system toHide">
                                            The load balancer was responsible for forming a layer of abstraction between the client and the
                                            server pool. It queued requests from the client, and recording server loads from the server pool.
                                            Each file requested by a client was stored at multiple server nodes, and the load balancer was responsible
                                            for determining the server currently under the lightest load. Likewise, the load balancer initialized the
                                            fault detetection system, and handled server crashes by redistributing files as necessaryr, even restarting
                                            active file transfers if necessary.<br/>

                                            In our implementation, the client naively requested files from a input file, without pausing
                                            in between requests. We used the client in our trials to test the performance and fault tolerance
                                            of our system.

                                            A node in the hash table represented a single process, that could leave or join
                                            the table arbitrarily. When the node was connected to the hash table, it
                                            was aware of its predecessor and successor in the ring, and held a table that
                                            connected to <code>m</code> other nodes. These tables at each node formed
                                            hypercube-like structure within the DHT, so that traversing the entire table to
                                            perform some action requires on <code>log(n)</code> time.

                                            Since each node was represented by a separate process, all communication between
                                            nodes occurred via network communication. Likewise, all requests, including
                                            finding data in the DHT, removing data from the DHT, or modifying the DHT
                                            structure itself, were processed concurrently. While simple, this implementation
                                            is scalable across many machines.
