    <h3>Automated Ubuntu Backup and Restore</h3>
    <i>How to backup your Ubuntu system using minimal space, dependencies, and effort.</i> &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; 9/1/2011 <br/><br/>
    <p>
        Recently, I discovered that on Ubuntu, or any Debian-based Linux operating system, you can backup
        and restore and restore all packages, independent of the system or architectures itself.
        In fact, I sought out this solution because I wanted to switch to 64-bit Ubuntu from 32-bit,
        and didn't want to manually restore my programs and settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        To backup all installed applications, we first backup <code>sources.list</code> and
        the list of installed packages:<br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <pre class="brush: plain">
                sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ./
                dpkg --get-selections > installed-software
            </pre><br/>
        </div>

    <p>
        To restore these packages on a clean build, we simply need to perform the following:
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <pre class="brush: plain">
            sudo cat files/sources.list > /etc/apt/sources.list
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install dselect
            sudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-software
            sudo dselect
        </pre><br/>
    </div>

    <p>
        I modified my own script to automatically install third-party applications that don't
        include PPA's for for Ubuntu, such as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and
        the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a>, and perform
        other automated configuration, such as configuring Java alternatives, and setting the default
        shell to <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The true benefit of using this method is that backups can be used for different Ubuntu architectures
        and versions, and backups require minimal space.
    </p>
