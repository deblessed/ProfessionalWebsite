                                <i>An asynchronous, client-side Javascript networking plugin</i> &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; 8/1/2011 <br/><br/>
                                <p>
                                    This summer, I spent the first month of my internship working on a project reminiscent
                                    of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, a powerful asynchronous server-side Javascript
                                    networking library. While node.js allows possesses tremendous ability to perform
                                    efficient Javascript networking, the current browser security model inhibits similar
                                    client-side functionality, until SockIt.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    SockIt, in a nutshell, is an NPAPI browser plugin that circumvents the traditional browser
                                    security model, allowing pages to perform low-level networking via client-side javascript.
                                    While it is being actively developed, it already possesses extensive TCP and UDP functionality,
                                    and even boasts a custom implementation of the heavily-used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>
                                    protocol that supports batch callbacks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Similar to node.js, its networking is performed entirely asynchronously, and it supports
                                    variety of cross platform browser. It is newly open sourced, and hosted on
                                    <a href="http://github.com/sockit/sockit">GitHub</a>, and extensive documentation and
                                    tutorials are available <a href="http://sockit.github.com/">here</a>.
