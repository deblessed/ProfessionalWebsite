                                    <h3>Automated Ubuntu Backup and Restore</h3>
                                    <i>How to backup your Ubuntu system using minimal space, dependencies, and effort.</i> &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; 9/1/2011 <br/><br/>
                                    <p>
                                        Recently, I discovered that on Ubuntu, or any Debian-based Linux operating system, you can backup
                                        and restore and restore all packages, independent of the system or architectures itself.
                                        In fact, I sought out this solution because I wanted to switch to 64-bit Ubuntu from 32-bit,
                                        and didn't want to manually restore my programs and settings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To backup all installed applications, we first backup <code>sources.list</code> and
                                        the list of installed packages:<br/>

                                        <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
                                            <pre class="brush: plain">
                                                sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ./
                                                dpkg --get-selections > installed-software
                                            </pre><br/>
                                        </div>

                                    <p>
                                        To restore these packages on a clean build, we simply need to perform the following:
                                    </p>

                                    <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
                                        <pre class="brush: plain">
                                            sudo cat files/sources.list > /etc/apt/sources.list
                                            sudo apt-get update
                                            sudo apt-get install dselect
                                            sudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-software
                                            sudo dselect
                                        </pre><br/>
                                    </div>

                                    <p>
                                        I modified my own script to automatically install third-party applications that don't
                                        include PPA's for for Ubuntu, such as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and
                                        the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a>, and perform
                                        other automated configuration, such as configuring Java alternatives, and setting the default
                                        shell to <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The true benefit of using this method is that backups can be used for different Ubuntu architectures
                                        and versions, and backups require minimal space.

                                    <i>An asynchronous, client-side Javascript networking plugin</i> &nbsp; &#183; &nbsp; 8/1/2011 <br/><br/>
                                    <p>
                                        This summer, I spent the first month of my internship working on a project reminiscent
                                        of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, a powerful asynchronous server-side Javascript
                                        networking library. While node.js allows possesses tremendous ability to perform
                                        efficient Javascript networking, the current browser security model inhibits similar
                                        client-side functionality, until SockIt.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        SockIt, in a nutshell, is an NPAPI browser plugin that circumvents the traditional browser
                                        security model, allowing pages to perform low-level networking via client-side javascript.
                                        While it is being actively developed, it already possesses extensive TCP and UDP functionality,
                                        and even boasts a custom implementation of the heavily-used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>
                                        protocol that supports batch callbacks.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Similar to node.js, its networking is performed entirely asynchronously, and it supports
                                        variety of cross platform browsers. It is newly open sourced, and hosted on
                                        <a href="http://github.com/sockit/sockit">GitHub</a>, and extensive documentation and
